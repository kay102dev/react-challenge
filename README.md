- Please be advised that as an extra step, I have integrated the application with a MongoDB server. The form located at
  the bottom of the UI is designed to capture the user's favorite brand and subsequently persist this data to a MongoDB
  server. Following this, the data is retrieved and populated within the UI table.

- Screenshots illustrating these functionalities are included below for your reference.
